# Simple Population Counter
---------------------

This is a simple web page where you can check the population for countries you can search for. The population is updated every second, by roughly calculating the population for today and tomorrow.

The API that provides the population figure is given below:

- http://api.population.io/1.0/population/Norway/today-and-tomorrow
- http://54.72.28.201/1.0/population/Norway/today-and-tomorrow


The main objective of this task is to be better understanding working with the DOM, Javascript, jQuery, JSON and AJAX.
