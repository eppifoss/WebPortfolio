# Web Portfolio
---------------

This repository is a collection of different projects small and big that I have done in web development.


## Simple Population Counter

This is a simple web page where you can check the population for countries you can search for. The population is updated every second, by roughly calculating the population for today and tomorrow.


## Fact Box

Generates Number trivia. Choose a number and it shows you a fact for that given number.


## Trailer updated
------------------
Stay upto date on the latest movies. Watch the trailer at trailer update.
